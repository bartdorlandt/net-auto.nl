# ðŸ‘¥  About us

The Netherlands Network Automation Meetup (NLNAM) is a volunteer-run meetup hosting periodic meetups in the Netherlands focused around network automation.
We aim to bring together network engineers, developers, and IT professionals interested in network automation to share knowledge, experiences and best practices.

## History

The idea to start a network automation meetup in the Netherlands was conceived in Prague between Bart and Dan, while having breakfast. This was during the [Autocon 3](http://networkautomation.forum/autocon3) event.
